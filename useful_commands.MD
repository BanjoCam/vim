#### Surrounding things with other thing  

- surround an entire line: yss__something__ 
- surround a word: ysiw__something__
- change existing ones: cs instead of ys

#### open buffer as vertical split:
- :vert sb N
    - where N is the buffer number

#### see _vimrc for shortcuts you've made.
- like, commaNT to trigger nerdtree
- or commaBG to cycle between dark and light backgrounds.
